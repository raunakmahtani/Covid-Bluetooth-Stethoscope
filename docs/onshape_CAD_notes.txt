---How do you rotate an assembly?-----------------------------------------------

    I hate that I can't see the top of the part in the selection tree.

--How do you measure stuff?-----------------------------------------------------

    Where is the measuring tape icon?


---Imports?---------------------------------------------------------------------

    What is best format for importing references to Onshape?  Clearly
    xxx.SLDPRT format fails.

    e.g.
    aa_battery.SLDPRT failed to translate:
    Imported file contains no translatable geometry.   <--- Huh?

    https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/uploadfiles.htm
    https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/translation.htm   <--- Start the journey here.

    Non-CAD files that are able to be imported into Onshape include:
        .pdf
        .mp4
        .png
        .jpg/jpeg
        .svg
        .gif
        .txt
        .md

    Onshape automatically imports and translates these CAD file formats for parts
    and assemblies, including wire bodies and sketch curves.

    Solid Edge (.par and .psm) 10 through 2019
    Importing Solid Edge sheet metal files (.psm) will not result in sheet metal
    models in Onshape. You have the ability to reference imported faces in the
    Sheet metal model and use the Thicken option to create an Onshape sheet metal model.

    Assembly files
    Parasolid B-rep (.x_t or .x_b) from v10 to v32.1.157

    NX1847, latest version NX 1847.2400, and NX1851

    Solid Edge 10 through 2019 (via a .zip file)
    For all assembly files, you must place all parts and the assembly in a zip file and import the zip file into an Onshape document. The zip file name must match the name of the top-level assembly. For more information, see Importing Files.

    Drawing files
    AutoCAD (.dwg) up to 2018
    DXF (.dxf) up to 2013

---How to measure in OnShape?-------------------------------------------------

    Click on element to be measured (say, line or surface). At the bottom right you will see the associated measure, for example, if you click on a line, you will see the length. If you select two elements simultaneously, you will see measures relevant to the relation between these two elements. An up arrow button near the measurement can be clicked to show more info. Here is an article for reference.
